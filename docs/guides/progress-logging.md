# Progress Logging Guide

When you need to document significant work that was completed, use the `holo progress` command to create structured progress log entries.

## Overview

Progress logging captures what was accomplished in a session or work period. It creates both a detailed log file and updates the main progress log with a verbose, scannable summary.

## When to Use Progress Logging

- **After completing significant work** - features, bugs, architecture changes
- **At the end of a work session** - document what was accomplished
- **After reaching milestones** - mark important progress points
- **When asked specifically** - "update progress log" or "log this work"

## How to Use Progress Logging

### CLI Command (Recommended)

**For simple content (short, no special characters):**
```bash
holo progress "Full detailed content here" --summary "Brief summary" --name "descriptive_name"
```

**For complex content (long, markdown, special characters):**
```bash
# AI agents: Write content directly to buffer file using file writing tools/functions
# File location: _memory/tmp/buffer
# 
# Example content to write:
# ## Major Accomplishments
# 
# ### Feature Implementation
# - **Added user authentication** with JWT tokens
# - **Implemented role-based access control**
# - **Created comprehensive test suite**
# 
# ### Technical Details
# - Used bcrypt for password hashing
# - JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
# - Added middleware for route protection
# - 95% test coverage achieved

# Then use buffer with optional summary and name
holo progress --from-buffer --summary "Authentication system complete" --name "auth_implementation"

# Or minimal usage (auto-generates summary and uses default name)
holo progress --from-buffer
```

**This single command handles everything automatically:**
- Creates detailed log file in `_memory/progress_logs/`
- Updates main `progress_log.md` with verbose summary
- No manual file editing or management required
- Ensures consistent formatting and structure

### Parameters
- **`CONTENT`** (optional): Full detailed content (required if not using --from-buffer)
- **`--summary=SUMMARY`**: Brief summary (auto-generated if not provided)
- **`--name=NAME`**: Custom name for the entry (default: progress_update)
- **`--from-buffer`**: Read content from buffer file - **recommended for complex content**

### Writing Effective Summaries

The summary should strike a balance between being too brief and too verbose. It needs to fully capture what was accomplished at a high level without duplicating the detailed content.

**Good Summary Characteristics:**
- **1-2 paragraphs maximum** - enough space to explain the scope
- **High-level overview** - what was accomplished, not how it was done
- **Bulleted lists when appropriate** - for multiple related accomplishments
- **Clear and scannable** - someone should understand the work without reading details

**Examples of Good Summaries:**

```bash
# Single accomplishment - clear and specific
--summary "Implemented user authentication system with JWT tokens and role-based access control"

# Multiple related accomplishments - use bullets for scannability
--summary "Completed database optimization initiative:
- Query performance improvements (40% faster)
- Index optimization and connection pooling
- Added comprehensive monitoring and alerting"

# Complex work - high-level overview with key outcomes
--summary "Major payment processing refactor improving reliability and maintainability. Split monolithic handler into modular components with proper error handling and retry logic. System now handles 3x more transactions with 99.9% uptime."
```

**Avoid:**
- **Too brief**: "Fixed bug" or "Added feature" (lacks context)
- **Too verbose**: Including technical implementation details (belongs in detailed log)
- **Vague**: "Made improvements" or "Updated code" (doesn't explain what)

### Writing Comprehensive Detailed Content

The detailed content should be as thorough as needed - think of it as a complete technical report or essay. There are no length limits; verbosity is encouraged for the detailed log.

**Detailed Content Should Include:**
- **Full technical implementation details** - how things were built, what approaches were taken
- **Architecture and design decisions** - why certain choices were made
- **Code examples and file locations** - specific implementation details
- **Testing and validation** - what was tested, coverage achieved, edge cases handled
- **Challenges and solutions** - problems encountered and how they were solved
- **Impact and implications** - what this work enables, performance improvements, etc.
- **Future considerations** - what might need attention next, potential improvements

**Think of it as:** A comprehensive technical document that future you (or someone else) could read to fully understand what was accomplished and how.

### Examples
```bash
# Basic usage (simple content)
holo progress "Added user authentication system with JWT tokens and role-based access control" --summary "Implemented user authentication system with JWT tokens and role-based access control" --name "auth_feature"

# With custom summary and name
holo progress "Identified and resolved race condition in payment validation that was causing duplicate charges. Implemented proper locking mechanism and added comprehensive test coverage." --summary "Fixed critical race condition in payment validation that was causing duplicate charges" --name "payment_bug_fix"

# Complex content using buffer (recommended)

## Content Requirements

### Main Progress Log Entry
The main progress log entry should be:
- **Verbose enough for high-level scanning** - you should understand what was accomplished without reading the detailed file
- **Use markdown formatting** - headers, bullet points, paragraphs for clarity
- **Include key details** - what was built, how it works, why it matters
- **Be comprehensive** - cover all significant aspects of the work

### Detailed Log File
The detailed log file should be:
- **Extremely comprehensive** - like a complete summary you'd give after finishing major work
- **Include technical details** - implementation specifics, architectural decisions
- **Cover impact and context** - what this enables, what problems it solves
- **Document next steps** - what should happen next as a result

## What to Include

### Always Include
- **What was accomplished** - specific features, fixes, changes
- **How it was implemented** - technical approach, patterns used
- **Why it matters** - impact, benefits, problems solved
- **Key decisions made** - architectural choices, trade-offs
- **Files modified** - specific filepaths and what changed
- **Testing status** - what's tested, what still needs testing

### Include When Relevant
- **Dependencies added** - new packages, versions, requirements
- **Configuration changes** - environment variables, settings
- **Documentation updates** - what was documented and why
- **Performance improvements** - speed, memory, efficiency gains
- **Security considerations** - vulnerabilities addressed, security improvements

## Common Scenarios

### After Completing a Feature
```bash
# Write comprehensive details to buffer first
# Buffer content example:
# ## User Profile System Implementation
# 
# ### Overview
# Implemented complete user profile management system with full CRUD operations,
# frontend interface, and cloud storage integration.
# 
# ### Technical Implementation
# 
# #### Backend Components
# - **Profile Model** (`app/models/profile.rb`): ActiveRecord model with validations
#   - Name, email, bio fields with appropriate length and format validations
#   - Avatar attachment using Active Storage
#   - Soft delete implementation for data retention
# 
# #### API Endpoints
# - **ProfilesController** (`app/controllers/api/profiles_controller.rb`):
#   - GET /api/profiles/:id - Fetch user profile
#   - PUT /api/profiles/:id - Update profile data
#   - POST /api/profiles/:id/avatar - Upload profile image
#   - DELETE /api/profiles/:id - Soft delete profile
# - All endpoints include proper authorization and input validation
# - JSON API format for consistent response structure
# 
# #### Frontend Components
# - **ProfileEditor** (`src/components/ProfileEditor.vue`): Main editing interface
# - **AvatarUpload** (`src/components/AvatarUpload.vue`): Drag-drop image upload
# - **ProfilePreview** (`src/components/ProfilePreview.vue`): Read-only display
# 
# #### S3 Integration
# - Configured Active Storage with S3 backend for avatar uploads
# - Image processing pipeline with ImageMagick for thumbnails

# - Rate limiting on upload endpoints

holo progress --from-buffer --summary "Implemented complete user profile system:
- Full CRUD API with validation and authorization
- Frontend components for editing and avatar upload
- S3 integration with image processing pipeline
- Comprehensive test coverage (100% backend, full frontend)" --name "user_profiles"
```

### After Fixing Bugs
```bash
# Write comprehensive details to buffer first
# Buffer content example:
# ## Memory Leak Resolution in Background Job Processing
# 
# ### Problem Identification
# Discovered critical memory leak in background job processing system causing
# production servers to run out of memory after 6-8 hours of operation.
# 
# ### Root Cause Analysis
# **Investigation Process:**
# - Used memory profiling tools (ruby-prof, memory_profiler)
# - Analyzed heap dumps from production servers
# - Traced object allocation patterns in Sidekiq workers
# 
# **Root Cause Found:**
# - Background jobs (`app/workers/data_processor_worker.rb`) were maintaining
#   persistent database connections that weren't being properly closed
# - ActiveRecord connection pool was exhausted, causing new connections
#   to be created outside the pool
# - Long-running jobs (data import/export) kept connections alive indefinitely
# 
# ### Solution Implementation
# 
# #### Connection Pooling Fix
# - Modified worker base class to ensure proper connection cleanup
# - Added `ensure` blocks to guarantee connection release
# - Implemented connection pool monitoring and alerts
# 
# #### Code Changes
# ```ruby
# # app/workers/base_worker.rb
# class BaseWorker
#   include Sidekiq::Worker
#   
#   def perform_with_cleanup(*args)
#     perform(*args)
#   ensure
#     ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.release_connection
#   end
# end
# ```
# 
# #### Monitoring Addition
# - Added Prometheus metrics for connection pool usage
# - Set up alerts when pool utilization exceeds 80%
# - Dashboard showing connection lifecycle and cleanup effectiveness
# 
# ### Testing and Validation
# - **Load testing**: Ran 48-hour stress test with heavy job processing
# - **Memory monitoring**: Confirmed stable memory usage over time
# - **Production deployment**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
# 
# ### Results
# - Memory usage stabilized at 400MB (down from 2GB+ before crash)
# - Zero memory-related crashes in 30 days post-fix
# - Job processing performance improved by 15% due to better resource management

holo progress --from-buffer --summary "Fixed critical memory leak in background job processing:
- Identified root cause: database connections not properly released
- Implemented connection pooling with proper cleanup
- Added monitoring and alerts for connection pool health
- Validated with 48-hour load testing, zero crashes in 30 days" --name "memory_leak_fix"
```

### After Architecture Changes
```bash
holo progress "Major architectural refactor splitting monolith into microservices. Created separate services for user management, payment processing, and notification delivery. Implemented API gateway for service communication and added service discovery. Maintained backward compatibility during transition." --summary "Refactored monolithic architecture into microservices with separate user, payment, and notification services, including API gateway and service discovery" --name "microservices_refactor"
```

### After Research/Exploration
```bash
holo progress "Comprehensive research into database migration strategies for large-scale data migration. Evaluated tools, approaches, and risks. Selected incremental migration approach with dual-write pattern. Created detailed migration plan and timeline." --summary "Completed comprehensive research and planning for large-scale database migration, selecting incremental approach with dual-write pattern" --name "db_migration_research"
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### With Context Refreshes
Progress logs complement context refreshes:
- **Progress logs** document what was accomplished
- **Context refreshes** capture current state and next steps
- Use both for complete session documentation

### With Offboarding
Progress logging is part of the complete offboarding process:
- Update progress logs for work accomplished
- Create context refresh for current state
- Update other Holocron files as needed

## Troubleshooting

### If You're Unsure What to Document
- Ask: "What would I need to know to understand what was accomplished?"
- Focus on significant work, not minor changes
- When in doubt, err on the side of documenting

### If Content Seems Too Verbose
- Remember: main log should be scannable but comprehensive
- Detailed log should be extremely thorough
- Better to over-document than under-document

### If You're Missing Information
- Review recent commits or changes
- Check what files were modified
- Consider what decisions were made
- Think about what problems were solved

---

**Remember:** Progress logging is about capturing what was accomplished so future-you can understand the work and its impact. Be comprehensive, be specific, and think about what you'd need to know to pick up where you left off.
